# Pybomber 2

There are two implementations here, one for browsers, and one for a
Desktop version, which should eventually become the standard
distribution for all desktop play.

This [project was originally
created](http://www.pygame.org/projects/20/194/) in 2005; this
should be a decent remake of it.
